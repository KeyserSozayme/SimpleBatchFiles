# SimpleBatchFiles

Just somewhere I can organize my batch files across multiple systems and keep them up to date while teaching myself batch scripting.

- Configurator -
This Batch script generates basic configuration files for Cisco switches or routers. Use it at your own risk as there is absolutely no input sanitization for checking that the generated config is compatible with the device you intend to apply it to.

- Folderer -
This script generated (by default) 500 "Please log out" folders and places them on your desktop. It is intended to be run on a collegue's computer as a joke or as a means of reminding them to lock their PC when they are going to be away form it.

- Minecraft Backup -
Just a script for personal user that robocopies my .minecraft directory to a networked backup location on login.

- Shutdowner -
A script I don't really use that just shut down your computer after 30 seconds. It was originally intended to be run at by deluge when torrents finished downloading but I don't use it anymore.

- tester -
Just a batch file I use to test commands I'm learning.

- EvilFolder-er -
The same as Folder-er but is places randomly generated files in each folder of choosable size, this is intended to make it difficult to delete all of the folders. During which time you can think about the repurcussions your, not locking of your PC can have on both your data, and your company's data.

- FolderWrapper -
Copies Evil Folder-er to the TMP directory before running it. This makes attacks easier as you only need to be at the PC to setup the attack, then you can unplug your USB and the program will continue uninterrupted!
